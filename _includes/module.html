      <p>My interests lie in cross-disciplinary quantitative research,
        applying mathematical and engineering concepts to fields of medicine, 
        sociology, finance, and biology. Some of my projects and publications include 
        Bayesian machine-learning approaches to improve radiation dose inference 
        in nuclear medicine, applying dynamic network and graph theory concepts to 
        evolving relations between social groups, and computational analysis of 
        biological pattern formation.
