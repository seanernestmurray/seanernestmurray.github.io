## The Dynamics of Alliance and Hostility in Social Structures

This MSc dissertation explores the formation of social structures on signed graphs from the perspective of dynamical systems. We outline what it means for a graph of relations to be balanced, motivated by concepts in social psychology. We investigate and compare existing models of opinion dynamics through gossiping mechanisms, and explore how they affect the structure of social groups. Such dynamics tend to diverge, hence we investigate known models that bound the opinions to a prescribed range. We then present new convergence proofs and prove the stability of different social states under such models.

We outline a novel control model, which nudges the opinions towards a social configuration prescribed by a state vector, termed the diplomatic target. We apply this model to two case studies: the alliances and enmity of nations in the period preceding WWI; and Zachary’s karate club study, a well-known example of group fission in network theory. Our model correctly classifies the final allegiances in both cases. We also introduce and investigate the bifurcating dynamics on two coupled graphs, known as a multiplex graph, and prove the stability of various fixed points of the associated system. We find that coupled graphs can tend toward separate states of balance and still be stable under the presented dynamics, interpreting this in the context of social networks.
